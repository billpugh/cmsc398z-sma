# Project Reflections

Complete the first three sections after Phase 1 (the first week). After completing Phase 2, update the second and third section and fill out the rest of the document.

## Phase 1 Experience

### Previous experience

What experience did you have before starting this project:

* Creating any web apps
* Using Flask to create a web app using Python
* Deploying a web app using PythonAnywhere or a similar service
* Creating style.css files to control the appearance of a web site

### What did you implement?

Did you have a goal for the kind of social media app you wanted to build?
What additional feature(s) did you implement? 

### What went well?

What aspects of Phase 1 were easier than expected or particularly satisfying?

### What was challenging?

What aspects of Phase 1 were difficult or frustrating? 

### How long did Phase 1 take you?

Roughly how long did it take you to complete the minimal features plus one additional feature? If you worked on additional features or deployment, how much more time did that take? 
Did you work mostly in one sprint, or did you work on it in multiple sessions? 

### Your impressions of Flask

What did you think of Flask? Do you think you would be able to use it now, with the help of Claude, to develop an entirely different web app?

### Deployment

Are you interested in deploying it to PythonAnywhere or another hosting platform? 

### Key learning moment

Describe one specific moment or concept in Phase 1 where something "clicked" for you.

## Working with AI Tools

Fill this out after Phase 1, and then come back and update it after Phase 2

### What worked well?

List 2-3 ways that using Claude (or your AI tool) helped you succeed:

1.
2.
3.

Provide a specific example of a particularly effective interaction with the AI tool.

### What didn't work well?

List 2-3 challenges you faced when working with the AI tool:

1.
2.
3.

Provide a specific example of a time when the AI tool was unhelpful or led you astray.

### Balance of understanding vs. generation

This project was designed to do something new: have Claude guide you through a learning process so that you would understand what was being created. Claude guides you from one learning objective to the next without requiring you to get bogged down in the details of how to implement each step. The intent was somewhat like that of a [video game on rails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_shooter). We hope this worked well for you.

Reflect on the balance between:
- Having AI generate code quickly
- Taking time to understand what was generated
- Not skipping over important learning opportunities
- Writing code yourself

Do you think your experience found the right balance? What would you change?

## Technical Growth

### What did you learn about web development?

List 2-4 key concepts you learned or solidified during this project:

1.
2.
3.
4.

### What concepts are still unclear?

What aspects of web development or these architectures do you still find confusing or want to learn more about?

### How is this different from previous projects?

If you've built web applications before, how was this experience different? If this was your first web app, what surprised you about web development?

## Phase 2 Experience 

Wait until you've completed Phase 2 to fill out the rest of this document.

### What was your approach?

Describe your Phase 2 implementation in 2-3 sentences:
- What features did you implement (remember: 3-4 core features, not full parity)?
- Did you reuse the Phase 1 database or create a new one?

### What went well?

What aspects of Phase 2 were easier than expected or particularly satisfying?

### What was challenging?

What aspects of Phase 2 were difficult or frustrating?

### Key learning moment

Describe one specific moment or concept in Phase 2 where something "clicked" for you.

## Comparing the Two Architectures

### Development Experience

| Aspect | Phase 1 (Flask Monolith) | Phase 2 (REST API + Frontend) |
|--------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Setup time** | | |
| **Ease of debugging** | | |
| **Speed of adding features** | | |
| **Understanding the code flow** | | |
| **Testing approach** | | |

### Which did you prefer and why?

Explain which phase you enjoyed more and why. Be specific about what made it better for you.

### When would you choose each approach?

Based on your experience:
- **Monolithic (Phase 1)**: What types of projects or situations would make this the better choice?
- **Separated (Phase 2)**: What types of projects or situations would make this the better choice?

### What surprised you?

What architectural difference surprised you the most? What did you expect to be different that turned out similar?

## Final Thoughts

**One sentence summary of your learning:**

In one sentence, what is the most important thing you learned from building the same app twice?

**Would you recommend this project to others?**

Would you recommend this project structure (building the same app twice) to other students? Why or why not?

**Deployment**

Now that you've gotten through the project, what is your interest/intent/experience with deploying this to a provider such as PythonAnywhere?

**Congratulations on completing both phases! 🎉**
